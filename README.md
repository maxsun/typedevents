Quickly add events to your calendar!

**How to Use**

Go to http://typed.events to use the *TypedEvents* web application. Enter events such as "CS Lecture in Wheeler 150 every Wednesday 1 to 2pm" or "Tennis Club MWF weekly 2 to 3pm" and press Enter to add them into the queue. When you add to your event, fields such as the location and time will autopopulate. The only required field is the title.

Once you finish entering your events, you can either download it as an ICS file on your local calendar or sign into Google to add them into your Google calendar.
